	<!-- SECTION 4: NARRATIVE STORY BLOCKS -->
	<section class="about-narrative">
		<div class="about-narrative__block">
			<h3 class="about-narrative__title">Part I: The Performance Architect</h3>
			<p>To augment my coaching abilities, I became a trainer and CrossFit coach, specializing in creating comprehensive programs that allowed athletes to achieve their goals and recover from injury. I quickly learned that true coaching requires understanding not just physical endurance but the positive mentality necessary to sustain complex regimens over time.</p>
			<p>My work centered on helping injured athletes make full recoveries, inspiring them to become stronger both physically and mentally than before. This experience taught me that rehabilitation is about more than restoration it's about transformation. This became my guiding mantra: "Rebuilt To Inspire."</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-narrative__block">
			<h3 class="about-narrative__title">Part II: Resilience Reframed</h3>
			<p>This passion for recovery unexpectedly expanded in the summer of 2019 when I was diagnosed with Stage III Germ Cell Cancer. Immediately, I realized my athletic history had trained me for this defining moment. I embraced the situation openly, sharing my story daily on social media during chemotherapy treatments and two major surgeries.</p>
			<p>Today, I am cancer-free and stronger than ever. This journey provided me with a first-hand understanding of the critical mental and physical challenges individuals face during their most vulnerable moments. It fundamentally reframed my approach: UX is applied empathy. Designing protocols for high-risk recovery demands the same meticulous attention to user needs and constraints required for enterprise digital products.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="about-narrative__block">
			<h3 class="about-narrative__title">Explorer of AI &amp; Future Systems</h3>
			<p>I now apply this system-centric mindset as an explorer of modern technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I actively test new ways every day to use AI tools from generative design prompts to technical documentation assistance to maximize efficiency and enhance creative output across every project touchpoint.</p>
			<p>My goal in exploring AI is twofold: Simplification and Optimization (making the design pipeline faster and more intuitive for users) and Creative Ideation (using AI to push creative boundaries beyond traditional limitations). I believe the most successful systems are those that are constantly optimized for resilience, clarity, and scalable growth.</p>
